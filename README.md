# AssociativeLearning_frontal-thalamic

This folder contains the original Matlab codes used to produce the fMRI results of human data for the manuscript entitled 'Human orbitofrontal cortex signals decision outcomes to sensory cortex during flexible tactile learning' published in Plos Computational Biology by Hummos et al.,

The successful running of these codes needs SPM toolbox (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/)
